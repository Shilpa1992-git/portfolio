This project implements a complete CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins, integrating Docker containerization and Kubernetes deployment. It demonstrates automated building, testing, and deployment workflows.

## 🧩 Features

- Declarative Jenkins pipelines
- Docker image building and pushing
- Kubernetes deployment automation
- Automated testing integration
- Multi-stage deployment (dev, staging, production)
- Rollback capabilities
- Notification system
- Artifact management

## 💡 Technologies Used

- Jenkins
- Docker
- Kubernetes
- Git
- Shell Scripting
- YAML

## 🚀 Pipeline Stages

1. **Source Control**: Git checkout and branch management
2. **Build**: Compile and build application
3. **Test**: Run unit and integration tests
4. **Containerize**: Build Docker images
5. **Push**: Push images to container registry
6. **Deploy**: Deploy to Kubernetes clusters
7. **Verify**: Health checks and smoke tests
